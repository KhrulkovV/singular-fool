TensorFlow implementation of the algorithm for generating universal adversarial
perturbations based on (p, q) - singular vectors (see [https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03582](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03582))
for details.

# Installation
For the installation clone the repository and run
```bash
python setup.py install
```
# Usage
An example of usage with Keras is given [here](https://github.com/KhrulkovV/singular-fool/blob/master/examples/vgg19.ipynb)
